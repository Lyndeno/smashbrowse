An online browser game you can play with your friends! 
Each player has their own floor, and their own server. The goal is to make sure your server doesn't get smashed.
Your server also makes you money! Use this money to upgrade your server, or upgrade your weapons
You are given a weapon to, well, smash other people's servers. You can hop from floor to floor, but if you leave your own floor, you are vulnerable to other players attacking you, as well as your server
Your server can also be used to DDOS other people's servers to bog them down and hinder their income.
This game is currently in the works, very broken and not playable :( sorry about that. More updates coming soon!
